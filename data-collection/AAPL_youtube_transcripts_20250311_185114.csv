trend affecting even the mighty magnificent 7 tech Giants this Market wide dip was fueled by a mix of anxieties including concerns about President Trump's renewed trade tensions and their potential impact on the global economy the Dow Jones S&P 500 and Nasdaq all felt the heat mirroring a global trend of Market uncertainty trade Wars and tariff threats tend to Spook investors creating volatility and prompting a flight to safer assets this risk averse sentiment undoubtedly played a role in Apple's decline dragging down even the most robust stocks adding to the market Jitters were concerns about Rising inflation and the Federal Reserve response the Spectre of interest rate hikes can dampen investor enthusiasm particularly in sectors like Tech that Ry heavily on future growth prospects Apple despite its strong fundamentals couldn't escaped this broader Market correction while external factors undoubtedly played a role it's crucial to examine Apple's internal Dynamics to understand the full picture the company faces its own set of challenges which when coupled with the market downturn created a perfect storm for this recent stock slump while Market forces exerted downward pressure Apple's internal challenges also contributed to the stock decline one significant concern was the company's announcement of a delay in its AI upgrades particularly for its Voice Assistant Siri investors accustomed to Apple's rapid Innovation cycle saw this delay as a sign of potential stagnation the tech landscape is fiercely competitive and any perceived slowdown can erode investor confidence Apple once synonymous with cuttingedge technology faced criticism for falling behind competitors in areas like AI powered Services smart home integration and foldable phone designs this Innovation Gap coupled with the AI delay fueled anxieties about Apple's future growth furthermore concerns lingered about iPhone sales a crucial Revenue stream for Apple while the iPhone series launch

NETWORK,2025-03-11T21:46:03Z,65,PT10M52S,welcome back everybody so I can feel it you know and I can smell it there's lot of fear out there in the market extreme here reading at 16 now we do have some big data coming out CPI 8:30 a.m. tomorrow and then we also have PPI and why I'm not actually scared of these you know pullbacks just 10% we're not even down 20% well we always have the backup and you can see apple puts we took uh two days a went deep in the money way over the money market was coming down Apple was at 240 we took these puts and this was a fantastic Play here's another one that we took and this is the one I want to talk about because when I have these why I cannot go and buy dips in the market because Market is not going to take my money anywhere and why 1129 2024 spy puts 555 June 20th expiration we're nowhere near June guys and it's already going in the money this is going to be a big play getting now so when I have these why cannot go and buy the dips I can go and buy the dips and that's why you know if you fear that market is going to crash you have to short at the top you cannot you know uh go and short when Market is pretty much down 10 15% and it's getting oversold and there is a rally that is actually Brewing and it could be right around the corner and you're shorting into the hole so you know all these plays guys you know especially if you're serious about trading definitely check out my link down here in the description and also I have it here on my X page and you can give me a follow if you're there and if you're actually uh on X right here uh

and all kinds of setups definitely check out their link down Below in the description for patreon and now let's get right into it guys on Google stack is down 1% so there was an attempt of a breakout it did not hold and we did close this Gap at 165 today and that is where we found support and it's holding right there so Google in pretty much No Man's Land we got another gap on top uh from yesterday 172 so now Google 165 and then 162 is going to be a crucial level to hold going into tomorrow's session with that CPI if we get a bounce maybe a gap up over 170 that opens the door for a move up to 17.25 to close this Gap and over that 176 and then we can talk about more upside on Google stock but for tomorrow 165 162 your key line in the sent right here on Google AMD it's actually green on the day and uh you know it's flat but still finishing the day in the green after making a new low 94.73% and holding 95 as a support into closing so AMD I don't know where this thing is going I mean it's just consolidating here and we're not down significantly we went back up to 100 and now back down to uh 95 again so 95 your key line the sand and then 93 on AMD to the upside now there will be resistant at 98.82% on Netflix is up 3.28% so this thing got up to 900 plus huge rejection from 900 904 uh off of this negative sloping 5day moving average blue line on your screen right here and now it's trading at 8.95 so now key line the S 872 and then 842 if this thing does not recover cannot get back up over 900 to 904 you're not going to see a bounce up to 9936 right here and if this thing gets up to 936 this might might be a good uh shorting opportunity on Netflix on Microsoft is absolutely flat on the day so we got bit of a bounce up to 386 and you can see now it's rejecting from uh 384 so this thing needs to get over 384 and then we might see a push up to 390 to 395 400 it's getting bit froy and oversold we see some you know uh high volume coming in today but nothing significant the bounce to the upside definitely not happening and it's been down you know quite a bit from all-time highs you can see what was it 465 down to 376 so it's a good diying opportunity but again uh this means uh you know go longer does not mean that you buy here and sell tomorrow that's not going to happen you might catch that bounce but you know I'm talking about longterm or at least you know give couple weeks to couple months so here on Microsoft the next key level to watch well lower B B here at uh 379 380 if this thing gets a bounce and gets over 384 we got a shot where this thing can move up to 390 possibly up to 394.455 over 400 it's going to look a lot more bullish for a move all the way up to 413 on meta it's Up 1.29% So Meta I actually bought the dip yesterday and today sold it because this thing rallied back up to where look at this six 14 pretty much exactly and then came back and holding right here over 600 so MAA over 600 we might see a push back up to 614 and over 614 this thing can come up and retest 623 to 638 this thing does not hold 600 this thing can come back down to lower Ballinger band 589 and from there it can go much much lower you can see we got a bunch of gaps down here and if this thing wants to come down I mean this thing is up quite a bit I mean from 7even 40 down to 600 yes it's down like $140 but it can go much much lower and if you need an example look at Tesla from 488 down to almost 200 now on Tesla's St is up 3.79% so this is actually really good opportunity and a lot of people are just scared you know just like when I made videos uh before the election uh about a year ago guys uh when this thing was down uh pretty much uh down here Tesla was dying and then people said oh don't buy it you know it's going to uh you know 50 bucks 80 bucks it was actually right here and uh we had that massive run to the upside brand new all-time high so you cannot count Tesla out ever just because it's going down does not mean that it's not going to come back up we got a bunch of gaps to the upside and we all know how these Works uh once we get into a uptrend here on Tesla so fantastic opportunity you know I already started buying some shares and shortly we'll be looking to buy longer time calls on Tesla uh you know I just uh actually wanted to wait for the CPI and the PPI and see you know what goes on with the turff and all that if the correction gets even deeper then I can buy it bit cheaper you know so Tesla here definitely you can see the bounce off of this uh 223 level and now trading at 230 if this thing get hold here we might see a push up to 240 251 258 to the downside underneath 220 three next big support will be right here at 205 on Apple stock is down almost 3% so Apple took a massive hit today and uh this is where we got into Apple puts right here guys two days ago Apple puts right here 23 puts you can see went deep deep in the money way over the money today unfortunately we sold yesterday but I can't complain uh even in the money you know you know Apple comes down 10 bucks you get a nice nice juicy paycheck so Apple now at 220 well there is no you know shorting here there is a gap and business down here that might get uh filled right here we got some unfinished business 26.90 it might come right here it was almost there today did not fill this Gap went back up and now holding at 220 So Below 220 we might see this Gap getting filled at 26.90 if we get some sort of a bounce apple is a big name trading below lower Ballinger band you don't see this uh you know type of moves too often we might go back up and retrace lower Ballinger bin not upper at 225 over that you might see a push up to 230 on Apple on Amazon stock is up 1% so Amazon finally you know catching a breather but look at that rejection at 200 guys exactly 200 got a rejection came back and now it's pretty much holding right here near 195 just over 195 so that's going to be your key Line This in 195 for Tom tomorrow you can see previous rejection now can act as a support underneath that level we still have unfinished business down here 190 Gap so watch out for that but if this thing you know gets over we got some high volume today uh there were a lot of buying if this thing gets over 200 we might see a push up to uh 206 212 maybe even 216 on Nidia stack it's up 1.66% so all day calls they were coming in and a lot of calls coming in on Nvidia and this despite the sell up in the market Nvidia did hold up really well and you can see uh we're actually over 107 it's finding a lot of buyers at7 this thing came back up up to uh 110 and now trading near 109 so again the key level and the key line in the send uh right here at 107 as long as we're over that we might see a push up to 118 on Nvidia stock if this thing gets under 107 in that case we might see a big move to the downside all the way down to $96 so watch out for that and that's all I have for you guys in this video please don't

uFvyoBsC0vY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFvyoBsC0vY,"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Analysis: Strong Growth, Short-Term Volatility &amp; Future Outlook | March 2025",Investing Talk Podcast,2025-03-11T21:00:42Z,2,PT15M,hey everyone welcome back to investing Talk podcast today we're going to be uh taking a closer look at Apple specifically their stock as of uh March 11th 2025 so if you're interested in getting a clear picture of where Apple stands in the market right now you're in the right place we've gathered insights from technical analysis news reports and the broader market trends right all with the aim of presenting you with a concise and easy to understand analysis so no need to feel overwhelmed by mountains of data exactly we'll filter out the noise and give you the essential information right our goal is to equip you with a knowledge you need to understand Apple's current position and its potential future because let's be honest the world of investing can be pretty complex especially for someone who's just starting out absolutely so we're here to break it down for you in a way that's approachable and insightful so to kick things off let's zoom out and look at the overall performance of Apple stock over the past year the stock has actually seen a pretty impressive rise yeah close to 28% it has been a really good year for them it really suggests that there's significant long-term confidence in the company it does it paints a picture of a company that's on Solid Ground yeah but it's important to note that there's been a bit of a shift recently oh interesting just in the past week we've seen the stock drop by about 3.6% and over the last month it's down around 2.2% so there's some recent volatility yeah could signal a bit of a change in sentiment among investors makes you wonder what driving those changes it's certainly something to keep in mind as we go through this and speaking of changes uh we can't forget that the stock hit an all-time high back in December that's right on December 26th it reached $260 now it's sitting at about $29.30 that's about a 15% drop from its peak could this mean we're witnessing a correction in the market it's a plausible explanation yeah because after such a substantial climb a period of adjustment isn't uncommon exactly what goes up must come down as they say and to give us a bit more context on the risk associated with Apple stock we have its beta which sits at 0.72 that's a moderate level of Market risk meaning it's not as volatile as some other stocks out there but still subject to fluctuations right and over the past year it's volatility has been around 3.40% so it's relatively stable compared to the broader Market but it's still important for investors to be aware of the potential for ups and downs absolutely no investment is completely risk-free now it's also worth mentioning that Apple has a truly enormous market capitalization almost $3.3 trillion and on average about 52 million shares change hands every day it's one of the most actively traded stocks that level of liquidity is generally a good sign for investors it usually means you can buy or sell shares without drastically impacting the price okay so we got a sense of the overall stock performance and Market context now let's dive into some of the technical indicators let's see what the numbers are telling us starting with the 50-day simple moving average or SMA we've seen it recently dip down to about $236 what does this tell you well when the price Falls below the 50-day SMA it usually means that the short-term momentum has weakened okay it's a sign that the upward Trend might be losing steam so in this case with the price dropping below that 23 level it suggests that the upward trajectory we saw earlier could be taking a pause and we might even see further downward pressure in the near term that's definitely a possibility so now let's compare this to the 200 day SMA the longer term Trend that one's currently around $233 180 it's still above the current stock price but the fact that the price is below both the 50-day and the 200 day SMA it's a signal worth paying attention to yeah it could be a sign that the longer term upward trend is being tested it's like a check engine light it doesn't necessarily mean there's a major problem but it's something to investigate further and you know whenever I hear about stock trends I can't help but think of this term death cross oh yeah that's a popular one is that relevant in Apple's case right now well a death cross happens when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200 day SMA right now we haven't seen that yet with apple yeah but the fact that they're getting closer together is definitely something something to keep an eye on because if that were to happen it could signal a more significant shift towards a bearish trend all right moving on to the relative strength index or RSI it's currently at 31.5 that puts it in neutral territory but leaning towards oversold what do that mean for potential investors well an RSI below 30 often suggests oversold conditions meaning that the selling pressure might be easing up soon so we could see the price stabilize or even bounce back cont but it's not a guaranteed signal of an immediate upward reversal right it's just one piece of the puzzle and how about the moving average convergence Divergence or man CD what's it indicating right now the max CD line is currently below the signal line at about negative -2.41 H this reinforces the bearish sentiment we're seeing so the selling pressure is still pretty strong it seems that way okay given all these technical indicators are there any specific price levels you're keeping a close eye on absolutely on the downside there's that $220 level okay that's been acting as a pivot point recently right and then there's the area around $234 which is close to the 200 day SMA if the price drops below 220 uhoh it could potentially head towards 210 wow that would be a significant drop or even lower okay so those are definitely levels to watch out for on the flip side we have resistance around 239 okay near near the 20-day SMA and then at $241 71 which aligns with a Fibonacci retracement level if we see a move above that 236 to 239 range it could signal the start of a recovery okay that makes sense now let's shift gears a bit and talk about some recent news and events that could be impacting Apple's stock price sounds good one big development that caught my eye was the announcement about the delay of the AI powered Siri overhaul yeah that was a big one they're pushing it back to 2026 it seems like the Market's a bit concerned about the implications for iPhone sales especially in a huge market like China and the overall roll out of apple intelligence it's been reported that this delay actually contributed to a 3% drop in the stock it really shows how news and events can have a direct impact on stock performance yeah even if the impact is just based on investor perception it's all about expectations but amidst all this Apple has also been releasing new products have we've got the new Macbook Air with the M4 chip updated iPads and even some entry-level iPhones trying to appeal to a wider range of customers so how has the market responded to these new releases it's been a bit of a mixed bag some sources have pointed out an 8.38% year-to-date drop in the stock price really despite all these new products it seems like investors might be looking for more substantial catalysts to really drive the price up or it could be that other factors like the overall e economic climate are playing a bigger role right there's always a bigger picture to consider speaking of the bigger picture we also can't ignore the uncertainty surrounding global trade especially with President Trump's policies Apple relies heavily on Manufacturing in China they do and any trade tensions between the US and China can really impact their bottom line remember that 5.6% drop in the stock in a single session oof yeah that was a rough day all because of tariff concerns it's a pime example of how geopolitical events can send shock waves through the market and while there have been efforts to ease those tensions like that pledge for a substantial us invest the immediate effects of any trade disputes can still be pretty significant for Apple's stock volatility is the name of the game in this globalized world all right now let's take a closer look at Apple's recent earnings figures the numbers that everyone's been waiting for for their first quarter of fiscal year 2025 which ended in December 2024 they reported a 4% increase in Revenue not bad reaching $24.3 billion and their earnings per share Rose by 10% so those are some positive signs they are but we also can't forget that iPhone sales actually dip slightly by 0.9% it's a reminder that even a giant like apple isn't immune to Market challenges yeah it's like a mixed bag of results it is some areas shining While others are facing headwinds and it's definitely influencing how investors are current currently viewing the company for sure mixed signals can make investors hesitant now it seems like the overall Tech sector is also playing a role here oh absolutely the tech industry as a whole has been experiencing some volatility including declines in some of the other major players which can create a ripple effect across the entire sector and even though the nasda Q has seen some dips there have been reports indicating a 5% game for Apple over the past month and a 2% rise after the Siri delay announcement apparently fueled by a $100 billion stock buyback program so it's interesting how different factors can push and pull the stock price in different directions it's a constant tug of war so let's delve a bit deeper into those earnings figures let's break it down you mentioned a 4% increase in Revenue that's right and a 10% rise in earnings per share two $240 so what were some of the highlights well the services segment stole the show really it achieved a record 26.34% increase it must be doing something right and they now have over 1 billion subscriptions across their various platforms so that's a major driver of growth for them absolutely the recurring revenue from subscriptions is a huge asset and what about their other products we saw solid growth in Mac sales okay up 15% reaching 8.99 billion and iPad sales also saw a healthy 10% jump to 8.09 billion so it's not all doom and gloom no far from it but we did talk about those slightly disappointing iPhone sales right a 0.9% dip totaling 6914 billion and the wearables home and accessories category also experienced a 2% decline a little bit of weakness in those areas but on the plus side the number of active Apple devices keeps climbing it does they reported a record 2.35 billion active devices that's a massive user base and a strong foundation for potential future growth so with all that in mind what's Apple's outlook for the coming quarter well for Q2 of fiscal year 2025 they're projecting mid to- low singled digigit Revenue growth okay not explosive but still growth and gross margins between 46.5% and 47.5% so they seem confident about their ability to maintain profitability they do especially with the strength of their services business so now let's look ahead to the Future what are some of the things that could shape Apple's stock in the long run well there's a lot of Buzz about a potential foldable iPhone oh yeah that's been in the rumors for a while it could launch as early as late 20 2026 or early 2027 that would be a pretty big deal it would open up a whole new market segment for them but they're also facing some challenges of course the competition in China is intense it is and sales there have been a bit up and down and they're also dealing with some regulatory hurdles for their AI initiatives in that region it's a complex landscape to navigate and let's not forget about the legal battles they're facing like that1 billion doll lawsuit in the UK all these things can create uncertainty for investors they can legal challenges always bring an element of risk and we can't Overlook their decision to develop their own cellular chip that's expected to be included in the iPhone 16e it's a bold move it could potentially disrup their relationships with current suppliers it's definitely a development to watch closely so as we wrap up this analysis what's the overall takeaway for investors well Apple's current price to earnings ratio is around 4% not super high it might not be a huge draw for income focused investors it's more about growth potential with apple and analysts have a pretty wide range of price targets from $184 to 325 that's quite a spread it reflects the varying opinions on Apple's future prospects but generally speaking it seems like there's a belief that Apple has strong long-term potential their fundamentals are solid and their services division is a Powerhouse but in the short term a bit of caution is advised there are those recent declines and the overall Market uncertainties to consider it might be wise for short-term investors to wait for signs of stabilization and from a technical analysis perspective it's important to keep an eye on those support levels around $234 and any potential bullish signals that might emerge so to sum it all up for you Apple stock has shown impressive long-term growth but has recently experienced some short-term dips it's been a bit of a roller coaster ride these fluctuations are being influenced by a number of factors delays in key features mixed reactions to new products ongoing trade concerns and a mixed earnings report it's important to remember that the market is constantly changing never a dull moment so make sure you're staying informed and considering all these elements as you make your own investment decisions absolutely due diligence is key and here's a final thought for you to ponder Apple's pushing hard to integrate AI across their entire ecosystem they are it's a major part of their strategy so how do you think the eventual success of those efforts like the enhanced Siri features will impact long-term investor confidence and Apple's overall valuation it's an interesting question to consider that's all the time we have for today thanks for tuning into to investing Talk podcast if you found this deep dive into Apple's stock insightful please consider subscribing giving us a like

What&#39;s Next? - March 11, 2025",Explain The Charts,2025-03-11T12:45:50Z,3,PT3M49S,welcome back to explain the charts today we're taking a look at Apple ticker symbol Apple it's March 11th 2025 and we're going to analyze the news and the charts to see what's going on with this Tech Giant recent news indicates some downward pressure due to broader Market concerns and apple specific issues so let's investigate the chart to see if those concerns are warranted first let's take a look at the daily chart to get a broader perspective we can see that the overall trend has been upward over the past year but we've recently experienced some significant volatility there's a clear pullback in the last few days zooming in on the more recent price action on The Daily we can observe a large red candle on March 10th 2025 this coincides with news of the Dow Jones diving likely influenced by President Trump's comments and the surprising iPhone problem that sent Apple stock reeling according to the street this big red candle suggests strong selling pressure and potential for further downside now let's switch to the 1hour chart to get a closer look at what happened on March 10th and how the price is reacting right now we can see even more detail of that sharp selloff on the 1 hour the price tried to recover slightly after the selloff but couldn't with a close at 227.50 there's likely resistance at around the 230 level looking at the immediate price action on March 11th we see open at 235.50 4 hit a high of 236.14 then fell down to a low of 224.210 that's a volatile range showing continued Market indecision and downward price pressure I'll be keeping my eye on the 230 and 224 levels in the short term now let's drill down to a 15minute chart for intraday trading insights this chart can help us identify any potential short-term reversal or continuation patterns on the 15-minute chart on March 10th and 11th we can see how the price continued to go down the intraday volatility appears to be significant if the price continues to fall through 224 then it will likely want to retest the 220 level where it found resistance back in November on the other hand if it recovers then it will likely head towards the 230 level again and try to retest 235.50 we will have to see how the rest of the day plays out to recap the key price levels to watch are 220 224 230 and 235.50 a break below 224 could signal a further decline towards 220 conversely a sustained move above 230 could indicate a potential rally back towards 235.50 given the current news environment including concerns about the iPhone and a potential recession I'd say there's a slightly higher probability of a further downward pressure in the short term however if the market reacts positively to any developments related to these challenges a rebound could be possible keep an eye on news related to Apple's upcoming product releases and any statements from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates as these could influence Market sentiment thanks for tuning in to explain the charts remember this is just an analysis not Financial advice always do your own research before making any trading decisions good luck and happy Trading

UM-UR1Jnnm8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM-UR1Jnnm8,Technical Analysis of Stocks: SPY / QQQ / NVDA / TSLA / AMD / PLTR / IWM / AAPL / ARM,The Finance Hydra,2025-03-10T23:16:11Z,9352,PT28M29S,all right apparently nothing can save the market anymore we are in a persistent downtrend and there is no technical evidence to justify a possible recovery inside so let's talk about strategy what we retail Traders can actually do at a time like this because this is the finance Hydra Channel where we have a practical focus on developing intelligent strategies to be applied in the market here the content is unbiased without guesswork without assumptions or good feelings right no all the analysis and ideas shared here are based on technical evidence facts and statistics always communicated in a direct and professional manner my name is Nathan welcome to another daily analysis video now yes spy is clearly bearish we are losing on another support level we lost recently we lost many critical support levels we lost the 585 after closing this Gap over here we saw a bullish reaction for one day but in the following day we saw another collapse then we found a support level above the 576 the previous Gap support from November 2024 support level over here on January 13 and uh it was a support level again for one day on March 5 then we lost it in the following day and then last week last Friday we saw another bullish reaction above the 567 so we can lose it right now today making another bearish reaction now okay so what the signals they they tell us they they tell us that spy is not supposed to turn bullish right here right now yet we still right now we have many resistance levels to work with all of our previous support levels are now resistance levels for the Spy ETF we are clearly below the 21 Day EMA the exponential moving average on the daily chart so we are not only in bearish territory but we also lack technical evidence supporting any bullish thesis over here in theory if spy does not react like tomorrow or as soon as possible we could easily drop to retest our next support level which is around 539 okay there is no technical evidence suggesting a bullish reversal ahead or even a bottom signal right here right now we are still very bearish rejecting Friday's bullish reaction losing another support level so the situation is not looking good for this spy ETF what's more whats more the previous support level at at 567 apparently is right now a shortterm resistance level when we take a look at the 1hour chart for instance we see that the 567 over here did act as a resistance level today what's more we are still consistently below the 21h hour EMA suggesting that yes the short-term trend is still clearly bearish and and along with this moving average the 567 is right now a double resistance area for this spy and the r deer ETF over here has absolutely no chance of reversing until it maintains its price below this double resistance level shortterm wise okay so for now we are still clearly bearish there is no bullish perspective the CU shares a very similar reading we are losing another support level 477 over here right by losing and the closing below the support level this suggests more correction ahead for the QQ in theory our next support level is at 448 there is no Buy Signal yet now you may ask okay Nathan there is no bu signal but are the indices are our main ETFs right now spy a good cell according to my trading philosophy it is not because as I always like to tell you guys guys Buy near support levels okay and if you're going to sell sell near resistance levels sell after an an approximation of the price of the 21 Day EMA okay if the K bounces again to the $500 area to this's moving average and if we see the confirmation of a top signal then all right then the cuq will be a crystal clear sell a crystal clear short but right now the CQ they spy ETF they are far away from their resistance levels So in theory we still could see a bounce but uh by seeing a pullback over here it is going to make any possible short opportunity less attractive because it all in the end it all depends on the risk reward relationship I do not like shorting after the bearish momentum was already materialized okay it feels like to me at least all right it feels like it is too late I I would I I would like to see a bounce to higher levels to retest higher resistance levels then we'll see okay then we'll see if it will make sense shorting or not but right now that's my personal trading methodology over here I like to use a good risk reward ratio in in my favor after seeing technical evidence supporting my thesis okay for now therefore for now I do not see any meaningful bullish opportunity but I do not see any amazing opportunity to sell or to short the Spy the QQQ when we take a look at the weekly chart over here on the weekly chart maybe the situation is a little bit different because if you have a longer time frame FR perspective you may be watching this double top chart pattern very carefully okay and if on the weekly chart we close below the 575 we are going to trigger this double top chart pattern on the weekly chart suggesting a real long-term bearish reversal all right so that would be a very very complicated scenario for long-term positions all right so if you are a long-term investor or if you like to trade a larger time frame right then that's the key point you want to watch because if we maintain the price below 575 again I'm going to repeat 575 we are going to trigger one of the strongest bearish reversal chart structures known in technical analysis on the weekly chart okay so that's going to be very problematic for you when we take a look at the K kill this one is already losing it's a asending Channel we saw a downwards breakout of this ascending Channel until then we were still maintaining the bullish bias because after all we we were inside an ascending Channel okay ascending we were going up okay the trend was still bullish right now we can't say that the trend is bullish anymore we closed below the $500 we did trigger this double top chart pattern and we are now losing this support line of this ascending Channel so officially we can't say that tech stocks are bullish right now anymore now but Nathan what if what if what if right we see a very nice bullish reaction tomorrow making a bottom signal closing above the 477 or maybe even closing above today's high because Nathan as far as I know this could be an exhaustion bar right I mean an exhaustion bar is a very big extremely bearish bar which happens after the bearish after the bearish sentiment was already materialized near a support level all right yes you are totally correct but guys there is no technical confirmation yet in order first to see more confirmation we got to see this bar getting rejected then and only then we may see another bounce and the remember I'm talking about a possible bounce I'm not I'm not talking about a meaningful bullish reversal because a bounce as far as I know any bounce to our resistance levels could be just another dead cat bounce and another opportunity to short okay right now we do not see any possibility of a bounce but if we see tomorrow yes if we see tomorrow a miraculous reaction closing above these key points then all right maybe we're going we are going to see another bullish rally ahead but for now I will remain skeptical regarding Nvidia because Nvidia is highly affected by the K by the Spy ETF and right now Nvidia is also looking terrible because we lost our major support level around the 115 okay we lost this support level we are still very bearish we do not see any meaningful buying opportunity there is no technical evidence suggesting a good buy right now but we are far away from our resistance levels so the risk reward ratio for a new shortterm position is not good for my standards okay so right now Nvidia is doing absolutely nothing and that's okay that's okay guys we can afford to do nothing that's one of the best Advantage we retail Traders have over the over the institutional investors okay a hge fun a hge fund manager a a Trader for a bank Etc these guys they have to trade every single day all the time all right they have to offer liquidity to the market so they have a lot of restrictions we are free to do whatever we want we can afford to wait and right now that's precisely what we are doing together that's what that's what I am recommenda to the members of the 5% project all right let's just wait okay let's wait for this mess ends and then we'll see if another opportunity appears or not right now there is no meaningful opportunity but uh I'm going to tell you guys the key point that that I am watching right here right now the $100 okay if we see any bullish reaction near the $100 I see nvidia's risk reward relationship getting very attractive again for a new long-term position knowing that yes any Buy Signal would be against the trend because the trend is right now bearish Nvidia is bearish on the daily chart on the weekly chart we are on the verge of making another bearish Pivot Point over here so if we see any bullish reaction Above This support level that could be a very nice opportunity for swing trading Nvidia opening a new long position that's how I particularly see Nvidia right now but for now there is absolutely nothing new going on Tesla Tesla on the other hand this one over here is not only collapsing but it is also losing critical support levels on the weekly chart we are insanely bearish I mean I mean here this week we dropped 133% last week we dropped 10% today we are dropping 15% so clearly the situation is a little bit crazy here in Tesla if this is an overreaction or not I don't know I don't need to know in order to trade well all that I know is that right now you may ask Nathan is this a possible exhaustion bar in Tesla well it could be it could be again because Tesla closed its previous open gaps over here this one and right now we are about to close this one if we see Tesla making another very insane bullish reaction Above This support level around $218 then okay maybe we're going to see bottom signal after closing this Gap after an exhaustion bar was materialized but right now guys right now again there is no meaningful technical evidence suggesting a Buy Signal the risk reward relationship for a new trade is not good for any long or any short position right now so just like on Nvidia just like on spy just just like on on the K I do not see any meaningful opportunity right now and guys Al of the most important stocks aren't giving anything clear to us right here right now there are still plenty of opportunities out there which is why I love the American Stock Market all right guys I am Brazilian okay and the Brazilian Financial Market is small tiny compared to the American one here we have few sectors low liquidity in most stocks but uh the American Market is incredible so from my point of view I love the countless opportunities we see over here even in a time like this and it is with this feeling of gratitude simply gratitude right that I would like to invite you to join our educational group the 5% project there I share various trading signals with you and of course on various talks

be this week all right so well take advantage of the 7-Day trial and uh see if you like our service the link to my website is in this videos description okay right here below videos description all right now Tesla insanely beish but uh since we are approaching a support level maybe we are going to see a meaningful opportunity next but right now guys right now there is no okay if I see any opportunity any buying opportunity over here I will promptly share on our 5% project but for now guys I do not see nothing okay there is absolutely nothing new over here Nvidia also lost our previous support level we have a very very nice trading record on N Video over here so and guys always waiting for a a crystal clear opportunity okay every single one of the trades we took here together they were all near support levels with good risk reward relationship for every single loss we take we make we make roughly for every single dollar we lose we make more than $2 in return and we have a win rate of roughly 70% so this is how you you achieve consistency using a crystal clear strategy and the our strategy relies on buying near support levels selling near resistance levels right now we are losing this support level we are far away from this key point we are nowhere near any resistance level so let's just wait for another opportunity in Tesla and Nvidia regarding AMD this one is insanely bearish all right lower highs lower lows it simply can't make higher highs higher lows right we do not see any meaning for recovery as far as I'm aware we are about to retest the $932 the next support level from October 2023 so it is a crystal clear support level for AMD we are heading towards this key point right now next there is not a single technical bullish evidence suggesting otherwise if we see bottom signal okay great but for now there is not a single bullish reaction that that could save AMD from a sharper correction to retest our next support level now you may ask Nathan what it takes for IMD to reverse this bearish sentiment we got to see higher highs higher lows again all right higher highs higher lows then and only then we may see another meaningful recovery on Nvidia Nvidia I'm so sorry AMD I mean all right so only by seeing higher highs higher lows breaking the 21 Day ma which is clearly a major resistance level for the stock only by breaking the 106 support level again as well only by breaking this area over here over here we could see AMD having a chance of reversing this bearish sentiment but for now guys for now I see absolutely nothing going on over here on AMD all right palun this one we at the 5% project we did try to capture a bottom signal here on paler but in the end it simply failed in reacting right now well we are about to retest the $72 again any any bullish reaction above the $72 could be a very good buying signal but for now guys this is just fiction okay we do not know the future we can't predict the future but we can react properly to what we see if tomorrow for for instance we see a very good bottom signal above the $72 then paler will certainly be buy I'm going to share a trading signal on paler on our telegram Channel and this is it but right now there is no such thing all right there is no such reaction we do not see anything meaningful right here right now on the weekly chart I know on the weekly chart we are retesting the 21

the CTA right it's a very good one now uh paler if we are going to see a reaction now is the best time to do so above the 21 weekly moving average near the $72 support okay now would be perfect we don't see yet but we could see one if we see one all right I'm going to promptly tell you guys here in this channel I'm going to I'm going to share the trading strategy on our telegram Channel but for now there is nothing iwm this one we also we also tried to nail a bottom signal over here right because iwm is a fantastic ETF to trade all right uh the members of the 5% project we bought I over here we sold over here we bought over here again right we sold over here now we are trying to nail another bottom signal it was about to make a bottom signal over here last week but uh in the end it failed miserably in doing so now we are losing this support level so it couldn't trigger any buying opportunity but if we see another bullish reaction near the 196 then I will be more convinced okay yes I know we are around the $200 right here right now but either way guys either way iwm lacks a crystal clear technical evidence suggesting a bottom signal over here okay we do not see any bullish reaction there is not a single bottom signal yet now Nathan if iwm makes a fantastic bullish reaction above the 196 over here would you buy it well of course because guys remember every single thing we do together every every single trading strategy relies on two things on the technical evidence and on the risk reward relationship because all we do has the only goal to maximize profits while mitigating losses we are not here to avoid losses okay we can't avoid losses but we can mitigate our losses because that's the main mistake retail Traders commit all right maybe maybe they are very successful Traders they they win most of the time but uh it takes only one single losing trade to destroy your account only single one okay so the main purpose the main secret over here is actually to know how to mitigate your losses while maximizing your profits because you got to make more than you lose if you lose more than you make then you're not consistent so right here right now all that I know is that any bullish reaction near a support level we'll have a good risk reward ratio and we're going to have a technical evidence supporting a bullish case right now we are still far away from our support level we are not seeing any meaningful reaction we are below the $200 so I'm so sorry we are below the 204 the previous support level over here so the situation is not looking good for iwm maybe it will be soon but right now it is not apple is Apple uh this is quite curious because Apple didn't lose its support level yet we have a clear support level around 227 over here we are stabilizing around this support level so it is an interesting a quite curious sign of strength now since we are around a support level you may ask Nathan if we see a bullish reaction could we buy yes because the risk reward relationship will be optimized but right now we see a possible exhaustion bar okay exhaustion bar stabilizing above a support level this is very interesting but we still lack technical evidence supporting a by signal supporting a by signal because guys I can't call this a Buy Signal okay it is not a bottle signal it is not we must wait for more our confirmation because waiting for confirmation is the main difference between gamblers and real Traders real Traders always wait for confirmation we always wait for the market to stabilize before before buying or before selling because we are okay in sacrificing part of our losses for more confirmation because sacri because by by waiting for confirmation we increase the probabilities of us of our bullish thesis or bearish thesis of getting right all right so we increase the odds in our favor because in the end we all want a consistency okay that's the main goal over here consistency so for now we do not see any confirmation if you want to buy near support level without confirmation all right you you have you are totally right in doing so as long as you know where your stop loss and where your target are going to be before you place the trade if you don't then you are just betting okay and here in this channel we do not bet all right 227 is a clear support level if we lose the 227 221 and the 221 is a way way stronger support level for us so it all depends on how apple is going to behave over here or in the worst case scenario over here okay if we lose these support levels apple is going to trigger a heading shoulders chart pattern right so this could be catastrophic for the stock and could bring us back to the to the $200 area down here so let's watch out for these key points for now arm Holdings I'm going to be honest with you guys we almost bought arm Holdings over here during this stabilization but uh in the end it failed in triggering our Buy Signal okay again that's why we always wait for confirmation right because by waiting for confirmation by not trying to bet on the market we avoid well unnecessary losses okay so right now arm Holdings is frustrating our previous bottom signal over here now we are retesting the 114 another support level that's very interesting but guys in the end we need to see a bullish reaction closing above the 123 in order to materialize a meaningful bottom signal if not arm Holdings is not going to be a buy again if it does again fantastic great I'm going to send to you guys the Buy Signal on our telegram Channel but for now today we are below this resistance level so there is no Buy Signal yet of course I'm going to keep you guys updated on this and on many other stocks here in this channel as well so again consider subscribing
